# PUBG Recoil

## FAQ

### How many weapons are included?
*All of them!*

### Why aren't there suppressors included?
*Suppressors do not have effect on the recoil, they are only affecting the sound of the weapon.*

### What hotkey is used for showing/hiding the app overlay?
By default you can use `Ctrl+J` for toggling overlay, but you can also change it by clicking on the settings icon in the top right navigation and clicking on the link.

### Are all of the weapon recoils have the same amount of bullets?
*Yes, each weapon's recoil has same amount of bullets.*

### The app works in-game but weapons are not loading?
*App is not dependent on any API therefore it's most unlikely that you will experience any loading issues. Please restart the app or try updating it.*
